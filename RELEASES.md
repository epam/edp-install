## Version 3.9.0 <a name="3.9.0"></a> (June 13, 2024)

## What's New

We are introducing the built-in pipeline tracker. This new feature allows you to monitor Tekton pipeline runs directly within KubeRocketCI, removing the need to open extra tabs in your browser. With pipeline statuses and details readily accessible, your workflow becomes more streamlined and efficient.

As usual, we are continuously working on refining the user interface. For better user experience, we've made a major contribution to optimizing KubeRocketCI. Changes affect almost all the aspects of using UI, whether it's codebase creation, deployment, third-party tool integration, platform settings, etc. Besides, now it features real-time pipelines within the KubeRocketCI so there is no need to navigate to Tekton to observe pipeline runs, their statuses are always at hand now.

Apart from that, we implemented GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) support. This allows you to seamlessly store your container images using GitHub's solution, offering more options for managing your container images.

Lastly, announce the Kiosk tool deprecation. For those who are looking for a tenancy management solution instead of an obsolete Kiosk, we encourage considering Capsule as a more flexible solution.

### New Functionality

## Version 3.8.0 <a name="3.8.0"></a> (March 12, 2024)

## What's new

To start from, we're undergoing a significant platform transformation as we reveal our new identity: KubeRocketCI. This rebranding endeavor underscores our dedication to innovation and marks the start of a fresh chapter in our journey.

This release introduces crucial improvements to our Tekton deploy pipelines. With this update, users have more freedom to customize Tekton pipelines to fit their needs, making deployment smoother. Whether users are setting up environments beforehand or conducting tests afterward, our new approach makes it easier.

For better convenience, we're introducing multiple Git Servers support. This major feature will be especially appreciated by those who spread their code over multiple version control systems.

In this release, we've broadened our support for repository platforms, including Azure Artifacts, Artifactory, GitLab Repository, and GitHub Registry. Additionally, we've enhanced Nexus to serve as a unified repository capable of managing application artifacts and container images. This improvement simplifies asset management by aggregating all development assets into one centralized location.

We've improved our KubeRocketCI portal user interface. The latest update introduces an enhanced stages menu, boasting a clearer and more comprehensive design. Additionally, we've revamped the Quick Links menu in the Configuration tab and streamlined the sections panel for easier navigation, all aimed at enhancing user experience.

To showcase the platform's accessibility, we've published EDP on the Civo marketplace. It means that users interested in deploying a Civo cluster, can also onboard EDP in just a few clicks. Watch our [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/QjZoPnIKDtA?si=FBNkrKtfZOn28rYV) to see how elementary it is.

### New Functionality

* The deploy pipeline logic has been reworked. With this change, users can personally set pre-deploy and post-deploy tasks for the deploy pipelines, which makes them highly flexible. ([#142](https://github.com/epam/edp-headlamp/issues/142))

## What's new

In this release, we introduce DependencyTrack and SonarQube widgets on the application details page, enhancing observability. The SonarQube widget provides essential information on bugs, vulnerabilities,  code smells, coverage, and duplications. Whereas DependencyTrack widget highlights potential security risks with severity levels.
With these widgets, it is getting much easier to monitor application's quality.

We've invested considerable effort in major user interface enhancements to make your navigation seamless. In the Configuration section, tabs are now intelligently categorized for an intuitive experience, each equipped with status indicators for easy integration tracking.
We have elevated the overall user experience to a more sophisticated standard, underscoring our commitment to providing a refined and intuitive interface. Additionally, we've included comprehensive descriptions for all sections, simplifying your navigation journey.

Originally developed to meet the specific requirements of internal EDP use, the Nexus operator has undergone a redesign to embrace general use cases. We are pleased to announce its availability on OperatorHub, allowing users to deploy this versatile operator independently for an enhanced experience.
Now, users can effortlessly leverage this independent component to enhance experience with Nexus.

In our commitment to optimizing your workflow, we've implemented Tekton cache support for CI pipelines. Jointly with pipeline dependency reorganization, this feature results in significant time savings.
Expect a remarkable improvement in the overall performance of Tekton pipelines, ensuring valuable time efficiency.

## Version 3.6.0 <a name="3.6.0"></a> (November 3, 2023)

## What's New

Exciting news! Our platform is now available on the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-u7xcz6pvwwwoa), providing users with an additional free installation option [via AWS Marketplace](https://epam.github.io/edp-install/operator-guide/aws-marketplace-install/).

In this release, we've significantly extended the Overview page, introducing various valuable enhancements. Alongside dynamic widgets displaying key metrics, such as CD Pipelines, Stages, Branches, Codebases, and Tekton Pipeline runs, the page now also features a user-friendly list of recent pipeline runs. These pipeline runs are thoughtfully designed with clickable links, enabling swift navigation to their corresponding details in Tekton. This major update offers a detailed view of your deployment processes and provides easy access to essential information, making pipeline management easier.

EDP Portal now offers a simplified and efficient way for registries integrating and managing. This improvement simplifies the process of registry integration and management, allowing you to focus on what matters most.

Introducing digital signatures using [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) for all artifacts within the platform. This significant security enhancement strengthens the overall safety of the platform.

We've implemented the Tree Diagram window for pipelines in both the Component details menu and the Overview page. This feature provides users with a comprehensive real-time view of the pipeline directly from the EDP Portal. Users can navigate to each pipeline task by clicking its name and zoom in or out for better observability.

We've also optimized the task sequence to reduce execution time, significantly boosting the overall performance of pipelines by decreasing the time required for pipelines to run.

In addition, the SSO Integration tab has been introduced in the Configuration section. Users can integrate a platform with the Keycloak identity provider in this tab.

## Version 3.5.3 <a name="3.5.3"></a> (September 28, 2023)

### Upgrades

* The Go language is upgraded to the [1.20](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.20) version.

### New Functionality

* Added two new buttons, "Show Logs" and "Show Terminal" to the Environments stage within the EDP Portal UI. These buttons empower users to effortlessly access logs and directly log into the associated pod, improving visibility and control during the deployment process.
* Implemented the capability to sign images when pushing them to Harbor. This added layer of security ensures that your images are signed and verified, enhancing the trustworthiness of your deployments.

### Enhancements

* Updated the Argo CD application creation process. The 'namespace' field in the 'destination' section of the Application resource is now sourced from the 'Stage.spec' resource.

#### Breaking Changes

* The Git Server status now provides a comprehensive error message when failing. If your cluster hosts multiple EDP environments, it is required to update the edp-codebase-operator. However, if you have only one EDP environment in the cluster, applying these changes is unnecessary.

### Fixed Issues

* Fixed issue when Build pipeline failed on sonar step for Go operator SDK.
* Fixed issue when the update-build-number-gradle task updated all the version keys presented in the build.gradle file.
* Fixed issue when successful codebase creation notification couldn't appear.

## Version 3.5.2 <a name="3.5.2"></a> (September 22, 2023)

### Enhancements

* We've streamlined the installation process by disabling SSO integration and excluding the edp-keycloak-operator installation by default, reducing initial setup prerequisites.


## Version 3.5.1 <a name="3.5.1"></a> (September 22, 2023)

### Routine

* The Artifact Hub annotations related to container images have been removed from the [Chart.yaml](https://github.com/epam/edp-install/blob/master/deploy-templates/Chart.yaml) file to prevent redundant checks.


## Version 3.5.0 <a name="3.5.0"></a> (September 21, 2023)

## What's new

In this release, we've streamlined EDP installation. The EDP installer now focuses on setting up only core components like edp-headlamp, edp-tekton, codebase-operator, and cd-pipeline-operator. Additional resources, such as Nexus and SonarQube operators can be installed separately. Moreover, the edp-sonar-operator is now accessible as a standalone solution on [OperatorHub](https://operatorhub.io/operator/sonar-operator).

To enhance the security of your software delivery process, we present a new feature: Security Supply Chain with Tekton Chains. It allows for securely capturing and verifying metadata, including source code, dependencies, containers, infrastructure, and applications. With the help of Tekton Chains, users can sign software artifacts with cryptographic keys (e.g., x509 or KMS) and store them in various backends like Tekton Results API or OCI registries. This feature also ensures compliance with [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/requirements) L2 and L3 provenance standards.

We've significantly restructured our secret management process. Currently, this updated secret approach has been implemented for the components, such as Jira, DefectDojo, DependencyTrack, Nexus, and SonarQube. EDP Portal has been equipped with the ability to both create and manage these secrets.

We've introduced [Capsule](https://capsule.clastix.io/) support to enhance our CI/CD platform, bringing tenant management benefits to our users. One of the key advantages of integrating Capsule is its multi-tenancy capabilities. With Capsule, we can now efficiently manage multiple tenants in our platform, isolating their environments, resources, and data. This means improved security, scalability, and resource allocation, ensuring a smoother experience for everyone using our platform.

The Configuration section has a new view, with redesigned Container Registry tab. Now, you can create integration secrets for Harbor or AWS ECR directly in the EDP Portal UI. Additionally, the Configuration section has two new tabs: GitOps and Links. In the GitOps tab, you have the flexibility to customize the default [values.yaml](https://github.com/epam/edp-install/blob/release/3.5/deploy-templates/values.yaml) file. Plus, you are able to create or edit EDP components from the Overview page using the Links section.

### New Functionality

* The `Values override` checkbox has been added to the CD pipelines in the Environments section. When this option is enabled, default values are overwritten with custom one when deploying a stage.
* The edp-keycloak-operator now supports setting multiple equally accessible URLs for one application. The edp-keycloak-operator version v1.17.1 has been published on OperatorHub.
* The `edpName` value has been removed from the values.yaml file. Now the default Helm values are used instead.
* The cd-pipeline operator now can use the Capsule tool capabilities to provide multi-tenancy.
* The `kioskEnabled` parameter has been removed from the values.yaml file. To enable Kiosk, use the `--set global.tenancyEngine=kiosk` parameter instead.
* Nexus-operator has been aligned to work with the LTS Nexus 3.58.1 version.
* The method Uint32 for generating cryptographic values has been replaced with the crypto/rand method to improve overall security.
* The `sonar_url` and `nexus_url` parameters have been deprecated in the values.yaml file and migrated to appropriate secrets.
* Now EDP Portal notifies users if no namespace is set in the EDP Portal settings.
* Now the Create button in the Components section is hidden in case if no Git Server or GitOps repository is connected.
* The link that refers to a newly created application is now displayed if it was successfully created in Marketplace.
* The Git Server provisioning has been modified. Now users can provision only one Git Server.
* The required fields for most tabs in the Configuration section have been redesigned.
* A new tab called GitOps has been added to the Configuration section. It is designed to create a repository that follows the GitOps approach where the parameter are stored. These parameters can override the default values of the CD application. GitOps entities in the contain a link to the values.yaml files from CD Stage.
* The DependencyTrack tab has been added to the Configuration section. It allows to add the DependencyTrack stage into pipelines to have an additional security scanner.
* The Configuration section now contains a new tab called Links. It enables users to create or edit EDP components that are usually shown in the Overview page of the EDP Portal UI.

### Enhancements

* The SonarQube scanner now uses Java11 to work with Java8 applications.
* The default host for the GitLab server is now set to `gitlab.com`.
* To make the UI more interactive, clicking on the Deploy/Update/Uninstall buttons in the Environments section is now accompanied by corresponding notifications.
* The `keycloakUrl` parameter has been moved to the OIDC section.
* The `admins` and `developers` fields for Keycloak users have been moved to the sso subsection.
* The `sso.enabled` parameter has been added to allow user to manage edp-keycloak-operator resource creation for Argo CD.
* The secret name pattern for Version Control Systems has been modified for GitHub and GitLab. The current secret name is `ci-github` and `ci-gitlab`.
* The docker-registry component has been renamed to container-registry in the Overview page.
* The `validateMaintainers` parameter is now disabled by default for the Chart Testing linter.

### Fixed Issues

* Fixed security issue when the NuGet token was shown in output logs.
* Fixed issue with external component logic when necessary secrets weren't mounted to Tekton tasks.
* The default versioning type on longer relies on the application version to prevent Jira integration issues.
* Fixed issue when Build pipeline failed for Go operator SDK on  the `sonar` step.
* Fixed issue when incorrect properties were set for the Git Server resource.
* Fixed incorrect the execution sequence in the update-build-number and SAST tasks for NPM.
* Fixed issue when the "Push" task pushed incorrect Java, C#, and Python application version into Nexus.
* Fixed unexpected Review pipeline failure on the `sonar` stage for Maven autotest codebase type if Clone or Import strategy is used.

## Version 3.4.0 <a name="3.4.0"></a> (August 18, 2023)

## What's new

Introducing the "Marketplace" section, a new addition designed to offer pre-configured templates that expedite application setup, simplify development, and improve templates management efficiency. Craft personalized templates aligned with your organization's requirements for enhanced process streamlining, time efficiency, and governance.

Presenting the integration of [Kubernetes Cluster Add-Ons](https://medium.com/epam-delivery-platform/edp-kubernetes-cluster-add-ons-4a3b4ccc4627) in our latest EDP release, featuring the Argo CD tool and GitOps methodology. [Our extensive array of add-ons](https://github.com/epam/edp-cluster-add-ons) streamline component management and installation at the Kubernetes level, extending EDP capabilities with an array of Observability, Security, and Scalability options.

In this release, we introduce the choice between the All-In-One and Shared Approach in EDP. The latest release enables users to optimize by utilizing shared components such as SonarQube and Nexus across multiple EDP tenants, streamlining accessibility and reducing operational complexity.

By incorporating Harbor into our ecosystem, we reaffirm our dedication to the cloud-agnostic essence of the EPAM Delivery Platform. While adopting Harbor as our default OCI compliant artifact storage, we maintain unwavering support for cloud-based container registries. This commitment empowers users with enduring flexibility to fulfill their distinct needs, exemplifying our drive to cultivate a dynamic and adaptable platform.

In this update, our technical shift aims to improve the User Interface by extending the developer-friendly configuration section across the platform. This involves transforming CD Pipelines into Environments for more precise and efficient management, reinforcing our commitment to enhancing platform efficiency and adaptability, accessible via both UI and CLI.

This update also brings Antora, an advanced documentation-as-code solution, seamlessly integrated into our Marketplace's Template. Empower your team to create, deploy, and maintain up-to-date documentation while freeing technical writers from design concerns.

EDP's scope goes beyond CI/CD excellence, notably in Keycloak management. If Keycloak is vital to your solution, consider its crucial aspects: streamlined user control, attribute updates, and deletions, along with realm, group, role, client scope, and client management. Simplifying this complexity through a declarative approach is where the Keycloak Operator excels, enabling efficient bulk user operations, streamlined realm management, and self-service Single Sign-On (SSO) integration for developers. Discover the EDP Keycloak Operator on [OperatorHub](https://operatorhub.io/operator/edp-keycloak-operator).

Our latest release has transitioned exclusively to Tekton deploy scenario. This shift optimizes feature implementation and aligns with evolving user needs. This change reflects our commitment to technical advancement and efficient delivery. Jenkins is no longer supported.

To strengthen security measures, we're [expanding our security checks by integrating](https://epam.github.io/edp-install/operator-guide/overview-devsecops/) a diverse array of open-source security tools tailored to specific functionalities. This enhancement provides security practices into the software development lifecycle through a robust DevSecOps approach.

## Version 3.3.0 <a name="3.3.0"></a> (May 25, 2023)

## What's new

In this release, [Headlamp UI](https://epam.github.io/edp-install/user-guide/) has been updated. Particularly, the component creation procedure has been significantly changed to be more intuitive. Users can also observe visualized autotest monitoring provided with clickable links to the corresponding Tekton pipelines. Also, we provided completely new component type called Infrastructure which is designed to build infrastructures powered by Terraform.

We are thrilled to announce that one of our features called Autodeploy is now also available for Tekton CI tool. It is designed to automatically define the latest artifact tag and upgrade this service on each environment where this service is deployed. This crucial feature aimed to automate the application update procedure when using Tekton.

With version 3.3.0, the Create and Clone strategies have become available for [GitLab/GitHub](https://epam.github.io/edp-install/operator-guide/import-strategy/) version control systems. This enhancement provides increased flexibility for onboarding your applications within our platform.

We have provided Java [Multi-Module](https://epam.github.io/edp-install/user-guide/add-application/?h=multi+module#codebase-info-menu) support for Tekton CI tool. This enhancement improves code organization, build time, dependency management, testing, parallel development, and overall maintainability of applications.

One of our major highlights is that code review pipelines can now be re-triggered manually to force their runs. This feature was implemented to simplify the code review process.

From now on, EDP supports Terraform infrastructure as an additional language out of the box. Better still, we have added the new frameworks, such as Vue, Angular and Express frameworks for JavaScript, Gin framework for Go and .Net 3.1 framework support for C# which migrated from the previous deploy scenario.

Apart from that, we are presenting our [EDP Introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsy1UKMb8vg&ab_channel=ThePlatformTeam). This video provides a comprehensive overview of the platform's capabilities and benefits, making it easier for users to get started and maximize their productivity.

Lastly, users can easily check their applications for bugs or other issues using [Autotests as a Quality Gate](https://epam.github.io/edp-install/user-guide/autotest/#add-autotest-as-a-quality-gate). This powerful addition allows users to conveniently add multiple autotests to any environment, be it development or production. By running the appropriate autotests, users can effectively evaluate the stability of your application and ensure it functions properly.

### Upgrades

* Alpine image version is updated to the [3.16.4](https://hub.docker.com/layers/library/alpine/3.16.4/images/sha256-0b29a7f4d42d6b5d6433ea91322903900e81b95d47d97d909a6e388e840f4f4a?context=explore) version.

### Enhancements

* To simplify secret creation workflow, Argo CD OIDC client can now be provided with custom secret name.
* In the `Components` menu in Headlamp UI, near the build status icon, the `Go to the Source code` and `Go to the Quality Gates` clickable icons is added to navigate users directly to the corresponding application code and quality gates.
* To simplify bug reporting procedure, templates for reporting GitHub issues in our operators are created. Please see an [example](https://github.com/epam/edp-keycloak-operator/issues/new/choose).
* The [codebase template](https://github.com/epam/edp-codebase-operator/blob/master/build/templates/applications/helm-chart/kubernetes/templates/deployment.yaml) chart has been refactored, so now it is aligned to upstream and  doesn't contain deprecated parameters.
* The .Net language option is hidden from the codebase creation menu for non-Jenkins CI tools.
* Now the `code-review` pipeline includes the `Dockerbuild-verify` stage that depends on the `build` step, thus allowing to build the application.

### Fixed Issues

* The `JenkinsFolder` repository URL is added for create/clone strategy if Jenkins deploy scenario is used.
* The hard-coded `project-creator` SSH user was removed, Git application path to Git repo provisioning was aligned.

## Version 2.12.0 <a name="2.12.0"></a> (August 30, 2022)

## What's New

EDP 2.12.0 version presents EDP Argo CD Operator that runs as an adapter layer between the EDP Platform and Argo CD and manages the EDP Argo CD Tenants. Argo CD is suggested as a solution providing the Continuous Delivery capabilities.

Another new EDP subcomponent is EDP Headlamp that is a new UI on React.js that will replace the EDP Admin Console in future releases. EDP Headlamp, based on the Kinvolk Headlamp UI Client, provides the ability to define pipelines and project resources in a simple way.

Now EDP also provides the implemented Static Application Security Testing (SAST) support allowing to work with the Semgrep security scanner and the DefectDojo vulnerability management system to check the source code for known vulnerabilities. SAST is introduced as a mandatory part of the CI Pipelines.

Since this release, External Secret Operator is a recommended secret management tool for the EDP components.

EDP operator manifests have been updated to the latest v1 API version. Now EDP Platform supports Kubernetes versions 1.22+ and runs on the 4.9 and 4.10 OKD versions.

Creating the IAM Roles for Service Account is a recommended way to work with AWS Resources from the OKD cluster.

* With v.2.10.0, EDP provides breaking changes and improvements in CI/CD process. For instance, the Jenkins job provisioner creates a Jenkinsfile (that contains the definition of the Jenkins pipeline) and configures it in the Jenkins pipeline as a pipeline script.
* From the Continuous Integration part, Jenkins pipelines are provisioned by a pipeline provisioner instead of a codebase operator. Please refer to the [Manage Jenkins CI Pipeline Job Provisioner](https://epam.github.io/edp-install/operator-guide/manage-jenkins-ci-job-provision/) page for the details.

### Enhancements

* Work with Ingress becomes intuitively clear, and the default Ingress creation process is improved.
* Golang tests are excluded from the sonar stage in the Code Review pipeline.
* The edp-codebase operator work is improved during Jenkins and Gerrit initialization.
* Login attempts are optimized by implementing synchronization on the access token cache for Keycloak.
* Stashing the hadolint files allows configuring the hadolint check.
* EDP allows to deploy and manage an application with the third-party dependency.
* In Keycloak, the id for a newly created realm is identical to the realm name.
* Events in Keycloak can be managed with a corresponding Custom Resource.
* In Keycloak, user attributes can be set using a corresponding Custom Resource.

### Fixed Issues

* Jenkins and Nexus deployments are fixed on the OKD cluster.
* A new branch can be created from an undefined commit.
* Empty 'Deployment Script' field in Admin Console by default.
* Jenkins is unable to create Jenkins agents.
* Code Review and Build pipelines fail on the sonar stage for .Net applications.
* The edp-cd-pipeline operator can not create a CD stage.
* Panic issue in case GetCodebaseImages doesn't exist.
* The unknown apiGroup field is removed in OpenShift RB.
* A user is unable to clone a codebase from a public repository.
* A Custom Resource is not deleted from a namespace after the codebase deletion from the EDP Admin Console.
* The whitespace in the git-tag stage is removed.
* Duplication of the key value in Keycloak during repeated reconciliation of KeycloakRealm Custom Resource is fixed.

## Version 2.9.0 <a name="2.9.0"></a> (September 30, 2021)

### What's New

With v.2.9.0, EPAM Delivery Platform offers more flexibility in deployment and work. Thus, EDP and all the prerequisites can be installed with Terraform tool or Helm.
IRSA for Kaniko (Kaniko is a tool for building container images from Dockerfile) is an optional step. Alternative is to [use instance profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html).
Kiosk, a respective multi-tenancy extension to manage tenants and namespaces, is optional and can be enabled or disabled during EDP deployment. It is possible to get the list of namespaces owned by a specific edp-tenant with the help of Kubernetes labels.

EPAM Delivery Platform allows to configure authorization for key roles in Jenkins in a declarative way. Now, Jenkins operator reconciles any changes in shared libraries specification. As for the Keycloak, it is possible to make Jenkins Keycloak client confidential and to manage attributes for service account in Keycloak with Keycloak Client Custom Resource.
In addition, the roles for Keycloak proxy can be set in Nexus.

There are Gerrit operator improvements: each Gerrit repository is presented as a Custom Resource in Kubernetes. Available branches are displayed in Gerrit Project Custom Resource.

## Version 2.8.0 <a name="2.8.0"></a> (July 16, 2021)

### What's New

With the version 2.8.0, EDP offers a number of breaking changes making the work on the project smoother. For instance,
Keycloak is set for work in multi-tenancy mode allowing to work on a set project without interrupting the work of others.
Within the version 2.8.0, it is also possible to create an application with an empty repository and create
namespaces using Kiosk API. The third-party service provision functionality and Exposing Info tab were removed from Admin
Console. Besides, the initial structure for a new documentation framework is added to GitHub.

There are enhancements in the EDP CI/CD framework, such as CI pipeline availability for Open Policy Agent (OPA), CI
pipelines defined for groovy-pipelines, and the possibility to apply a specific logic and customize the Init stage of
a CD pipeline.

See the list of actions required to work with EDP v.2.8.0, new functionality and enhancements, as well as the list of
fixed issues and updated documentation below.

 #### Breaking Changes Actions

 * Init prerequisite is removed from the Deploy pipeline and added as a standalone stage.

   Reload *jenkins-operator* pod once EDP is updated to version 2.8.0.

 * New Autodeploy functionality requires updating CodebaseImageStream resources.

   Update all CodebaseImageStream resources with *spec.codebase: {application-name}* field to which Codebase belongs this
 resource.
 ```yaml
 spec:
   codebase: {application-name}
   imageName: stub
   tags:
     - created: stub
       name: stub
 ```

 * CDPipeline CRD:
    * New *deploymentType* field has been added to spec. Available values: Container/Custom

      Container - default way to deploy applications from the registry.

      Custom - an empty CD pipeline is created in Jenkins (with the Init stage only).

 * CDStageDeployments CRD:
    * Spec has been changed. Resource stores only one tag to deploy it automatically on Jenkins.
 To fix the autodeploy for EDP v.2.8.0, remove all old CDStageDeployment resources from the cluster.

 * CDStageJenkinsDeployments CRD:
    * Spec has been changed. Resource stores only one tag to deploy it automatically on Jenkins.
 To fix the autodeploy for EDP v.2.8.0, remove all old CDStageDeployment (as CDStageJenkinsDeployment resources have owner
 refs to CDStageDeployments resources, it is only necessary to remove CDStageDeployments) resources from the cluster.

 * Codebase CRD:
   * New *emptyProject* field has been added to spec. Available values: true/false.

     True - codebase will be created without template code (Create strategy).

     False - codebase will be created with template code (Create strategy).
