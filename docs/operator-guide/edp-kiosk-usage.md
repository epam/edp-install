!!! Agenda
    * blue - created by Helm chart;
    * grey - created manually

## Usage

* **EDP installation** area on a diagram is described by following [link](install-edp.md);

* Once the above step is executed, **edp-cd-pipeline-operator** service account will be linked to **kiosk-edit** ClusterRole
  to get an ability for leveraging Kiosk specific resources (e.g. Space);

* Newly created stage in `edp` installation of EDP generates new Kiosk Space resource that is linked to edp Kiosk Account;

* According to Kiosk doc the Space resource creates namespace with RoleBinding that contains relation between service account
  which is linked to Kiosk Account and **kiosk-space-admin** ClusterRole.
  As **cd-pipeline-operator** ServiceAccount is linked to Account, it has admin permissions in all generated by him namespaces.
